rfc
===

This is the ZeroMQ RFC project.

We collect specifications for APIs, file formats, wire protocols, and processes.

The change process is C4: http://rfc.zeromq.org/spec:16 with a few modifications:

* A specification is created and modified by pull requests according to C4.
* Each specification has an editor who publishes the RFC to http://rfc.zeromq.org as needed.
* Each specification has a status on that website: Raw, Draft, Stable, Legacy, Retired, Deleted.
* Non-cosmetic are allowed only on Raw and Draft specifications.

The ZMTP PLAIN mechanism defines a simple clear-text user/password mechanism for ZMTP/2.1. The ZMTP PLAIN mechanism allows explicit authentication of peers at the ZMTP transport level.

++ Change Process

This Specification is a free and open standard[((bibcite fandos))] and is governed by the Digital Standards Organization's Consensus-Oriented Specification System (COSS)[((bibcite coss))].

++ Language

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED",  "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119[((bibcite rfc2119))].

++ Goals

The ZMTP PLAIN mechanism is intended to provide ZMTP-level authentication for non-confidential use cases. This is, for example, in a data center where clients want to be certain they are connecting to the right server, but where confidentiality is not a requirement.

Additionally, PLAIN MAY be used when the transport layer provides security but no authentication (e.g. over a VPN).

Finally, PLAIN acts as a model for properly secure mechanisms such as ZMTP CURVE.

++ Implementation

The PLAIN mechanism requires that the binding peer be "server" and the connecting peer be "client". It consists of a four-message exchange as follows:

[[code]]
plain       = C:HELLO S:OKAY C:PROPERTIES S:PROPERTIES

HELLO       = username password
username    = string
string      = length *OCTET     ; 0 to 255 octets
length      = OCTET
password    = string

OKAY        = "OK"              ; 2-octet message

PROPERTIES  = message           ; Connection properties message
[[/code]]

The connection properties message is defined in ZMTP/3.0[((bibcite zmtp30))]. The server will treat the connection as successful when it receives and has validated the client's properties message. The client will treat the connection as successful when it receives a properties message from the server.

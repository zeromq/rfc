The ZMTP-PLAIN mechanism defines a simple clear-text user/password mechanism for ZMTP/2.1. The ZMTP-PLAIN mechanism allows explicit authentication of peers at the ZMTP transport level.

++ Change Process

This Specification is a free and open standard[((bibcite fandos))] and is governed by the Digital Standards Organization's Consensus-Oriented Specification System (COSS)[((bibcite coss))].

++ Language

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED",  "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119[((bibcite rfc2119))].

++ Goals

The ZMTP-PLAIN mechanism is intended to provide ZMTP-level authentication for non-confidential use cases. This is, for example, in a data center where clients want to be certain they are connecting to the right server, but where confidentiality is not a requirement.

Additionally, ZMTP-PLAIN MAY be used when the transport layer provides security but no authentication (e.g. over a VPN).

Finally, ZMTP-PLAIN acts as a model for properly secure mechanisms such as ZMTP-CURVE.

++ Implementation

The ZMTP-PLAIN mechanism requires that the binding peer be "server" and the connecting peer be "client". It consists of a single "hello" message from client to server as follows:

[[code]]
zmtp-plain  = C:hello 
hello       = username password
username    = string
string      = length *OCTET         ; 0 to 255 octets of data
length      = OCTET
password    = string
[[/code]]

Following the hello message, the client SHALL send a connection properties message as defined in ZMTP/3.0[((bibcite zmtp30))].

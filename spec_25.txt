The ZMTP CURVE mechanism provides secure authentication and confidentiality for [http://rfc.zeromq.org/spec:23 ZMTP 3.0]. This mechanism implements the [http://curvezmq.org CurveZMQ security protocol]. It is intended for use on public networks where security requirements are high.

++ Goals

The ZMTP CURVE mechanism provides secure authentication and confidentiality for [http://rfc.zeromq.org/spec:23 ZMTP 3.0]. This mechanism implements the [http://curvezmq.org CurveZMQ security protocol], which is a mapping of the [http://curvecp.org CurveCP] handshake, adapted for TCP transports.

++ Implementation

The CURVE mechanism uses the greeting as-server field to identify which peer is "client" and which peer is "server".

The mechanism starts with a HELLO command from client to server, and continues with a handshake until each party has authenticated the other and is ready to send confidential information.

All command bodies consist of an 8-character command name, padded with spaces, followed by formatted binary fields. The http://rfc.zeromq.org/spec:23 ZMTP 3.0 specification] defines the grammar for the command size. The [http://rfc.zeromq.org/spec:26 CurveZMQ specification] defines the grammar for the command bodies.

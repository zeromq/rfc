++ Language

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED",  "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119[((bibcite rfc2119))].

++ Goals

The ZMTP-CURVE mechanism provides secure authentication and confidentiality for ZMTP/3.0. This mechanism implements the CurveZMQ security handshake[((bibcite curvezmq)]], which is a mapping of the CurveCP[[(bibcite curvecp)]] handshake for TCP transports.

++ Implementation

The ZMTP-CURVE mechanism requires that the binding peer be "server" and the connecting peer be "client". It consists of a four-message exchange as follows:

[[code]]
zmtp-curve  = C:HELLO S:COOKIE C:INITIATE C:PROPERTIES S:PROPERTIES
HELLO       = message    ; CurveZMQ HELLO
COOKIE      = message    ; CurveZMQ COOKIE 
INITIATE    = message    ; CurveZMQ INITIATE
PROPERTIES  = message    ; CurveZMQ MESSAGE holding connection properties
[[/code]]

The connection properties message is defined in ZMTP/3.0[((bibcite zmtp30))]. The server will treat the connection as successful when it receives and has validated the client's properties message. The client will treat the connection as successful when it receives a properties message from the server.

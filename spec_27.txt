This document specifies ZAP, the ZeroMQ Authentication Protocol. The use case for ZAP is a set of //servers// that need authentication of remote clients, and which talk to an //handler// that checks client credentials. ZAP defines how the servers connect to the handler, and the messages they exchange.

++ Overall Design

+++ What Problems does ZAP Address?

When a server needs to authenticate a client it has to choose between either doing the authentication itself, or calling on an external party to do this work. While built-in authentication is simple to understand and build, it is limited in many ways:

* It cannot easily be extended to arbitrary security mechanisms.
* It cannot integrate with external authentication systems.
* It tends towards customized designs so that each product has its own approach.

For security administrators, the ideal design has all applications calling on the same central repository of credentials. The problem then becomes, "how do we standardize this interaction?"

As in all distributed designs, ZeroMQ already provides a large part of the answer by defining a common message-based transport layer that can be used in any language and on any platform. The second part of the answer is an simple protocol on top of ZeroMQ.

ZAP is such an protocol, specifically aimed at authentication.

+++ Reducing The Component Count

One undesirable side-effect of building distributed applications is that the number of components increases. This makes it harder to build products that are simple to install and use. If we designed ZAP naively to use a TCP transport and external handler, we would end up with additional services to install and run even for the simplest application.

So, ZAP uses an //inprocess bridge// design. That is, ZAP itself requires that the handler run as a thread within the same process as the servers. When an application uses multiple processes, each process will contain a ZAP handler. 

A ZAP handler can then talk to further components if the architecture needs it. ZAP does not specify this dialog but we assume that the ZAP messages can be forwarded as-is, with the addition of routing information for replies.

+++ ZAP is a Remote Procedure Call

ZAP uses the ZeroMQ request-reply pattern. Specifically, the servers use a REQ socket, and the handler uses a REP socket. In practice the servers may use DEALER sockets in order to send multiple requests at once, and handlers may use ROUTER sockets for the same reason. Furthermore, ZAP messages contain the request-reply address envelope so that requests can be sent along multiple intermediaries, and replies will return to the right server.

+++ Extensible Security

ZAP makes no assumptions about the security mechanisms we use, nor how they work. An authentication request starts with the name of a mechanism (an ASCII string), followed by credentials (an opaque binary blob whose significance is known only to the security mechanism). Additionally, the server specifies a //domain// (an ASCII string), which the handler can use to implement access controls. The authenticator replies with an OK/NOT OK response, with a user id that the server can use to identify the user to internal application code.

+++ ZMTP 3.0 Compatibility

ZAP is designed to support http://rfc.zeromq.org/spec:23/ZMTP implementations (i.e., provide a way to implement ZMTP 3.0 authentication) though it is not limited to this use case. This document specifies how the ZMTP PLAIN and CURVE mechanisms are implemented over ZAP, though these may get their own RFCs later.

+++ Message Format and Version Detection

ZAP uses a simplistic multi-frame format for its messages, where the version number is in the first frame. This is meant to be easiest to implement in arbitrary languages.

++ Formal Specification

+++ Architecture

ZAP defines a message-based dialog between a //server// that makes authentication requests, and a //handler// that answers them. The server and handler SHALL communicate using the following socket types and transports:

* The server SHALL use a REQ or DEALER socket.
* The handler SHALL use a REP or ROUTER socket.
* The handler SHALL bind to the endpoint "{{inproc://zeromq.zap.01}}".
* The server SHALL connect to this endpoint.
* There SHALL be one handler in a process.
* There MAY be any number of servers in a process.
* The handler SHALL start before any server starts.

+++ Message Format

An authentication dialog SHALL consist of one request from a server to the handler, with one reply from the handler back to the server.

The request message SHALL consist of the following message frames:

* An address delimiter frame, which SHALL have a length of zero.
* The version frame, which SHALL contain the three octets "1.0".
* The //request id//, an opaque binary blob.
* The //domain//, which SHALL contain a string.
* The //mechanism//, which SHALL contain a string.
* The //credentials//, which SHALL be one or more opaque frames.

The reply message SHALL consist of the following message frames:

* An address delimiter frame, which SHALL have a length of zero.
* The version frame, which SHALL contain the three octets "1.0".
* The //request id//, an opaque binary blob.
* The //status code//, which SHALL contain a string.
* The //status text//, which SHALL contain a string.
* The //user id//, which SHALL contain a string.

The various fields have these meanings:

* request id: the meaning of this is defined by the sending server only. The reply SHALL echo the request id without modifying it.
* domain: this requests authentication within some domain. The significance of domains are an application issue and not relevant to ZAP.
* mechanism: this specifies the security mechanism to authenticate against. The mechanism SHALL NOT be empty.
* credentials: these provide the user credentials to authenticate. The number of frames needed is defined by each mechanism.
* status code: this shall be "200" to indicate success, "300" to indicate a temporary error, "400" to indicate authentication failure, and "500" to indicate an internal error (system failure).
* status text: this shall be a text that further explains the status, and MAY be empty.
* user id: this provides the user identity in case of a 200 status, for use by applications. For other statuses, it SHALL be empty.

All string fields are at most 255 characters and are ASCII only.

+++ Socket Types

The ZeroMQ REQ and REP sockets manage address envelopes automatically, while the DEALER and ROUTER sockets expose these to the calling application, which must manage them explicitly.

* When using a REQ socket, the server SHALL not send nor receive an address delimiter.
* When using a REP socket, the handler SHALL not send nor receive an address delimiter.
* When using a ROUTER socket, the handler SHALL receive an extra frame indicating the identity of the peer that sent it the request. The handler MUST send this identity frame at the start of its reply message.

+++ Proxy Handlers

A handler MAY act as a proxy for other handlers. This is how we connect external authentication handlers using ZAP. In this case the handler will connect or bind to a {{tcp://}} endpoint, and external handlers will bind or connect to that endpoint.

In a proxy architecture the handler SHOULD forward ZAP messages with no modifications except:

* The handler MUST use a ROUTER socket for talking to servers.
* The handler MUST send the whole received message (including the first identity frame) on to external handlers.

More generally, a terminal (non-proxy) handler that deals with an unknown number of intermediaries between it and the servers MUST accept an address envelope consisting of N identity frames followed by an empty address delimiter frame. It MUST save this envelope before processing the request, and MUST send the same envelope back with the reply. This is what a REP socket does, so in general terminal handlers will use REP sockets.

+++ The PLAIN Mechanism

The PLAIN mechanism defines a simple username/password mechanism for ZMTP v3.0 that lets a server authenticate a client. PLAIN makes no attempt at security or confidentiality. It is intended for use on internal networks where security requirements are low.

To perform authentication for the PLAIN mechanism:

* The mechanism SHALL be the 5 characters "PLAIN".
* The credentials SHALL consist of two string frames: a username and a password.

+++ The CURVE Mechanism

The CURVE mechanism provides secure authentication and confidentiality for ZMTP v3.0. This mechanism implements http://rfc.zeromq.org/spec:26/CURVEZMQ security mechanism. It is intended for use on public networks where security requirements are high.

To perform authentication for the CURVE mechanism:

* The mechanism SHALL be the 5 characters "CURVE".
* The credentials SHALL consist of a 32-byte long-term public key of the peer being authenticated.

+++ Discovery

ZAP does not define how to discover handlers on the network. Some plausible options are hard-coded TCP endpoints or beacon discovery (as implemented by http://rfc.zeromq.org/spec:20/ZRE).

++ Reference Implementation

A minimal empty reference implementation is provided in the RFC repository at https://github.com/zeromq/rfc/src/spec_27.c. This implementation demonstrates a server talking to a proxy handler over {{inproc://}}, talking to an external terminal handler over TCP. The terminal handler implements a PLAIN authentication mechanism.

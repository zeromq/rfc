The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED",  "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119[((bibcite rfc2119))].

++ Goals

The Majordomo Management Interface (MMI) defines a namespace and set of management services that MDP brokers may provide. MMI is layered on top of the 7/MDP protocol.

The goals of MMI are to:

* Define a namespace for management services provided by a MDP broker to MDP client applications.
* Define a default set of management services that MMI-compatible brokers SHOULD implement.

++ Architecture

+++ Namespace

An MMI broker implementation MUST handle all services that start with "mmi." internally. It MUST disconnect any workers that attempt to register servics in this namespace.

+++ Default services

An MMI broker implementation MUST implement these services:

* **mmi.service** - accepts a request containing a service name, responds with "200" (Found) if there is at least one worker registered for the service, or "404" (Not found) if there are no workers registered for the service.

Any unimplemented services in the "mmi." namespace MUST result in a reply "501" (Not implemented).

+++ Reference Implementations

The C99 Majordomo examples from Chapter 4 of the Guide[((bibcite guide))] act as the prime reference implementation for MMI. Translations of the examples into other languages may be available.
